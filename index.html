          <p>I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati. I'm an
            international student originally from Ha Long, Quang Ninh, Vietnam. My hometown is a beautiful coastal city
            next to Ha Long Bay. If you have a chance please make Ha Long your next destination, you won't regret it! We
            have wonderful seafood and accommodation at a very affordable price, great services for any tourist, and on
            top of that a glamorous bay right next to our city. Visiting Ha Long Bay would be an experience of a
            lifetime!!</p>
          <p>Enough about my hometown, let's talk about myself. I'm currently working to get my degree in Computer
            Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I'm pursuing the path of becoming a PhD, so I have been very keen on
            doing research lately. I'm currently working on a research in <abbr
              title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, specifically Generative AI. There are a lot of different
            aspects within Generative AI, but right now, I'm mainly focusing on Diffusion Model, which is a Machine
            Learning model that takes inspirations from a phenomenon in physics called "diffusion".</p>
          <p>Aside from doing research, I'm also an avid software engineer. I love to tackle software problems that
            would require logical thinking and mathematical approaches. I really like how the problem can be debunked by
            using a combination of several different algorithms in programming. My favorite algorithm so far is the
            Bellman-Ford algorithm which is used to compute shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the
            other vertices in a weighted digraph. Sounds kind of complicated right? But trust me it will get
            "exponentially" more interesting as you learn more about it!</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about something outside of the programming realm so that people don't think I'm a huge
            computer nerd (which I probably am). I watched a lot of movies growing up, and what I mean by a lot is over
            <strong>1000 movies</strong>!! My favorite genres are fantasy and <abbr
              title="science fiction">sci-fi</abbr>. I think because of this I have always had an urge to go for an
            adventure. As a child I would imagine myself being a character from The Lord of the Rings, fighting the evil
            and saving the world. As I grew older, my imaginative mind helped me find the beauty in nature. Being in the
            nature allows me to find peace and relaxation, keep me optimistic, especially when my enormous workload is
            trying devour me. Hence, every now and then, me and my friends would go on a camping trip, stay out of city
            lights, and enjoy some fresh air.
